# English: Luanti OS is a "Game" that simulates a functional operating system

The system works with the management of forsmpec simulating the traditional tasks of a PC

Luanti os is a personal project that I decided to show to the community

Changes are expected if necessary since it is not 100% finished.

The system currently counts 10/15/24

with a calculator with basic operations, logarithms, exponents and trigonometric functions

an option to display desktop content

and a system for creating real-time files that can be added directly to the system file directory and built itself

Note: It is necessary to disable mod protection since mods create and delete files in their root directories: Minetestgame/Games/operating_system


to make a new lua create it from the files and add its dofile to init.lua
